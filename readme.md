# Wordpress Static File Browser

This plugin allows you to add links to files that are not in the media library. Just create the folder `/wp-content/uploads/static` and place some files in it. The files will appear in the new tab "Static File Browser" in the media library popover. From there you can add links to these files.

## Installation

Place the plugin folder in `/wp-content/plugins/` and activate the plugin inside Wordpress.
